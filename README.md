# HTML_tutorial: a first step on how to build a webpage ðŸ“ƒ
This project is just a simple tutorial on how to build an HTML document so as to use it later alongside other projects.

The aim of this tutorial is not simply educational, as it is meant to be used as an input parameter for the 
[CPP_HTTP_Server **_SetPathToResources_**](https://github.com/JonMS95/CPP_HTTP_Server?tab=readme-ov-file#usage) API function.

As no compilable data is found within it, there's no versioning for this project.
